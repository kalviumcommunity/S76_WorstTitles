# S76_WorstTitles

Welcome to the ** S76_WorstTitles**, This project takes a fun look at some of the most ridiculous and puzzling movie title translations from around the world. Whether it’s a cultural misunderstanding or a translation gone hilariously wrong, these titles show how films can take on a whole new life in different languages. It’s a lighthearted celebration of the quirks and charm that come with sharing stories across cultures using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview


#### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack:
**MongoDB :** A database for storing application data in a flexible, document based format.
**Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
**React.js :** A framework library for building User Interfaces.
**Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

#### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
We'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.


#### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.


#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
